🚨 IMPORTANT NOTICE TO OUR VALUED CUSTOMERS 🚨

Dear Customers,

We want to bring your attention to an important aspect of our 3D printed products, specifically regarding color gradients. Our 3D printing process involves a combination of advanced technology and craftsmanship to deliver high-quality products. However, it's crucial to note that due to the nature of 3D printing and variations in materials, we cannot guarantee identical color gradients for every print.

What to Expect:

🌈 Natural Variations: The color gradient in 3D prints may vary slightly from one item to another due to factors such as material batches, print settings, and environmental conditions.

🎨 Material Influence: Different materials may exhibit variations in color, sheen, and texture. This can contribute to unique and beautiful characteristics in each individual print.

📸 Representation in Photos: Please be aware that product images on our Etsy store may show the general appearance of the item, but the actual color gradient may differ slightly in your received product.

Our Commitment:

🛠️ Quality Assurance: While we cannot guarantee identical color gradients, we assure you that we are committed to delivering products of the highest quality. Each item undergoes a thorough quality check before being shipped to you.

📦 Secure Packaging: Your 3D printed items are carefully packaged to minimize the risk of damage during transit, ensuring they reach you in the best possible condition.

We appreciate your understanding and support as we navigate the unique aspects of 3D printing. If you have any questions or concerns about the color gradient of your specific order, please feel free to reach out to us. We are here to assist you and ensure your satisfaction with your purchase.

Thank you for choosing Eclipse3D. We look forward to serving you with exceptional 3D printed creations!

Best Regards,
Eclipse 3D Team
